There are 5 files:
* bucket.hpp
* bucketsFunction.hpp
* driver.cpp
* README.txt
* Report Paper.pdf


Use the driver.cpp to compile the project using Linux OS on C4 lab machines


Open the project folder, right click and hit “Open in terminal” or change the directory to the project folder


Type the commands to execute the project:
        $ g++ -Wall driver.cpp -o bucket
        $ ./bucket

Then refresh the folder and you will see the file output.txt. Now the output values were stored in there.
